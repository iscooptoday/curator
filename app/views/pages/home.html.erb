       <p>Iscoop is a link sharing site. The way it works is that you create a topic that you are passionate about and every day you submit 5 links to the topic. And everyone who follows that topic will get the links on a daily basis.</p>
       <p>Any one can create a topic and start sharing links on a daily basis with followers</p>
